# Hi there 👋

I'm an engineer working at the intersection of **industrial automation** and **applied artificial intelligence**.

👨‍🎓 Studying M.Sc. Applied Artificial Intelligence (part-time)  
🎓 B.Eng. Mechatronics  
🛠 PLC Programmer in special machinery 
> Engineering first. AI where it makes sense.
---

## What I actually do

- Design, program and retrofit industrial machines (PLC, real-world constraints included)
- Build Python-based systems for data analysis, visualization and decision support
- Connect classical engineering with modern AI methods instead of treating them as buzzwords

---

## Technical focus

**Industrial & Systems**
- PLC programming (industrial automation, special machinery)
- System architecture, clean interfaces, maintainable code
- Linux, Git, structured workflows

**Software & AI**
- Python (data analysis, APIs, dashboards)
- Interested in data visualization and analization projects
- Applied AI with emphasis on robustness and explainability

---

## Current interests

- Bridging automation engineering and AI in practical applications
- Clean project structures over quick hacks
- Long-term maintainability over demo-driven code
